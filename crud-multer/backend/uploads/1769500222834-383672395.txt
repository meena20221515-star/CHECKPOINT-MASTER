I am building a React + Material UI (MUI v5) application.

I uploaded an image. 
I want the UI and behavior to be recreated EXACTLY like the screenshot.

Requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
1. Create the SAME layout, spacing, colors, icons, alignment, and table structure as in the image.
2. Page title: "Checkpoint Master"
3. Top card:
   - "Add New Checkpoint" form
   - Fields: Checkpoint Name, Date, Add Todos (with + icon), Upload Files (Select Files button)
   - CLEAR and SAVE CHECKPOINT buttons
4. Bottom card:
   - Title: "Checkpoint List (5)"
   - Table columns:
     S.NO | Checkpoint | Date | Todos | Actions
   - S.NO should be circular numbered badges (1, 2, 3...)
   - Todos should show bullet-style rows with file icons
5. Actions column:
   - Eye icon → View popup
   - Pencil icon → Edit popup
   - Delete icon → Delete confirmation
6. Clicking View should open a MUI Dialog (popup) showing checkpoint details.
7. Clicking Edit should open a MUI Dialog with editable form fields.
8. Do NOT mix file preview dialog with edit/view dialog.
9. Files upload is OPTIONAL and preview-only (NO download button).
10. Use clean React functional components and proper state separation.
11. Use dummy JSON data (no backend).
12. Code should run WITHOUT ERRORS.

Output format:
- Provide FULL React component code
- Include all necessary MUI imports
- No pseudo code
- No explanations
- Only working code

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and continue.
